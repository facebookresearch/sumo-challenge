# Contributing to the SUMO challenge API

The SUMO challenge API is primarily a set of utilities to support
participants in the SUMO challenge.  As such, we do not anticipate significant
ongoing development in this project.  However, the software is not perfect,
and we encourage participants to provide bug fixes if they identify any.  We
want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.
